## Swing Arm

### Description

for this assignment I was given a chart on some of the dimensions and was asked to make a swing arm

### Evidence
[The Swing Arm in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/a9d714a54bf7e763301912e2/w/e7d0a16cdcb7d3f9fbc721c5/e/260464a46e3e2a39f160d54c)

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
